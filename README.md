This data is the Jail Profile Survey from California. These data include highly detailed information about the inmates in jails in the state at the jail-month level and the county-month and county-quarter level of analysis.

The data was scraped from the California Board of State and Community Corrections' website here https://app.bscc.ca.gov/joq//jps/queryselection.asp

There are three data sets available: facility/jail-level data monthly, county-level data monthly, and county-level data quarterly. Each of these data sets offers different variables. All the data sets have the variables indicating the years, month (or quarter), and jurisdiction (in most cases the county sheriff). I added variables with the FIPS county and state codes and county names from the US census.

The PDF available for download is the instruction manual from the California Board of State and Community Corrections to employees who submit the jail survey data. This manual indicates how variables are created and can help with understanding the data. I recommend reading it before using this data.

I did not make any changes to the except for the following: Changed column names to make it more informative and shorten names to fit the 32 character limit for Stata. Some cells had the values D and U to represent Does Not Apply and Unavailable. In both of these cases I changed those cells to NA. I did this to allow the column to be numeric for analysis.
